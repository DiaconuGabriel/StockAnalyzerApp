How it works?

You need to write your ticker and select the dates you want to get your analysis. After you select multiplier and range. That means how much data you want to analyze. Shorter ranges like minutes are best for smaller timeframes (e.g., a week). You can select 1 minute since that is not that much data for the AI to analyze. If you want to analyze longer timeframes (e.g., 1-2 years) you should use ranges like hours, days, or weeks due to the large data volume. Once the settings are selected, clicking "Generate Report" will fetch the data and provide an analysis. Errors may occur during API calls, but the system will notify you if thereâ€™s an issue.
